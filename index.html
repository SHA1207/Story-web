        <h1>The Surprise at Mount Pink</h1>
        <p id="para1">
            In a faraway land, there lived a little mountain named Fuji. Fuji wasn't like the other mountains. He wasn't tall and rugged, and he didn't have a pointed peak. Instead, Fuji was short and round, with a gentle slope.
        One day, a sprinkle of cherry blossom seeds drifted down from the sky and landed on Fuji's slopes. Fuji watched with delight as the seeds sprouted into tiny pink trees. The trees grew taller and taller, and soon Fuji was covered in a beautiful blanket of cherry blossoms.
        Fuji was so happy. He looked around at the other mountains, but they were still bare and brown. "I wish I could share my beauty with them," Fuji thought.
        Suddenly, a rainbow appeared in the sky. <br>

        stretched from one end of the land to the other, and its colors shimmered brightly. The rainbow landed on Fuji's peak, and then it began to move.
        The rainbow flowed down Fuji's slopes, carrying the cherry blossoms with it. It spread out over the land, painting the other mountains in shades of pink and white.
        Soon, all the mountains were covered in cherry blossoms. They looked up at Fuji, who was beaming with pride. From that day on, Fuji was known as the Mountain of Blossoms, and every spring, the rainbow would come and share its magic with all the mountains in the land.

        <h1>The Wishing Mountain</h1>
        <p id="para2">
            Once upon a time, there was a beautiful mountain that was always covered in pink flowers. The mountain was so tall that it seemed to touch the sky. People from all around came to visit the mountain, and they would often leave wishes at the top.
            One day, a little girl named Lily came to visit the mountain with her family. Lily had always wanted to see the mountain for herself, and she was excited to finally be there.

        <br>
            As Lily and her family hiked up the mountain, they saw all sorts of different animals. They saw deer, rabbits, and even a few bears! Lily was amazed by all the wildlife.
            When they finally reached the top of the mountain, Lily was breathless. The view was even more beautiful than she had imagined. The pink flowers stretched out as far as she could see, and there was a rainbow in the sky.
            Lily took a deep breath and made a wish. She wished that she could always be happy.
